# Decisions

Append-only. A changed decision is a new entry that supersedes the old one; only an
old entry's Status line ever changes.

## D1 · 2026-09-25 · Release commits go straight to main

Why: one command runs start to finish; a PR would stop `/release` halfway, waiting
for a merge, with the version already chosen.
Rejected: release branch plus PR (pauses mid-release; only needed for a protected
main, which zuko's repos do not have today).
Source: specs/release.md
Status: active

## D2 · 2026-09-25 · zuko computes the release version itself

Why: the rule is four lines — breaking gives major (minor below 1.0.0), feat gives
minor, fix gives patch — and zuko already parses the commit types for the changelog
gate.
Rejected: git-cliff (a dependency for four lines), semantic-release (a Node
dependency that releases without a human yes), commitizen (a Python dependency whose
changelog lines are commit subjects, already rejected by the changelog slice).
Source: specs/release.md
Status: active

## D3 · 2026-09-25 · No feat, fix or breaking commit means no proposed release

Why: a version number promises a change; with none since the last release there is
nothing to promise. semantic-release and commitizen both default to no release here.
Rejected: proposing a patch anyway (a patch promises a fix nobody made).
